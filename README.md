# Blog-Api
This is a project I decided to complete to make sure I could do more than just copy code.
Its to be a single user blogging app.
Features include 
-CRUD Users
-CRUD Post
-CRUD Categories
-CRUD Messages
-CRUD Subscribers
-CRUD Notifications
Relationships between various components (Users,Post,messages,subscribers ...)
Still working on it and a later version will implement this logic with a server side rendering template and other features
